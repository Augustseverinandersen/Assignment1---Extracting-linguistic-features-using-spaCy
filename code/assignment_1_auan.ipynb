    "This assignment concerns using ```spaCy``` to extract linguistic information from a corpus of texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corpus is an interesting one: *The Uppsala Student English Corpus (USE)*. All of the data is included in the folder called ```in``` but you can access more documentation via [this link](https://ota.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/repository/xmlui/handle/20.500.12024/2457).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you should write some code which does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loop over each text file in the folder called ```in```\n",
    "- Extract the following information:\n",
    "    - Relative frequency of Nouns, Verbs, Adjective, and Adverbs per 10,000 words\n",
    "    - Total number of *unique* PER, LOC, ORGS\n",
    "- For each sub-folder (a1, a2, a3, ...) save a table which shows the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Filename|RelFreq NOUN|RelFreq VERB|RelFreq ADJ|RelFreq ADV|Unique PER|Unique LOC|Unique ORG|\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|file1.txt|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|file2.txt|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|etc|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to test that you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Work with multiple input data arranged hierarchically in folders;\n",
    "2. Use ```spaCy``` to extract linguistic information from text data;\n",
    "3. Save those results in a clear way which can be shared or used for future analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data is arranged in various subfolders related to their content (see the [README](in/README.md) for more info). You'll need to think a little bit about how to do this. You should be able do it using a combination of things we've already looked at, such as ```os.listdir()```, ```os.path.join()```, and for loops.\n",
    "- The text files contain some extra information that such as document ID and other metadata that occurs between pointed brackets ```<>```. Make sure to remove these as part of your preprocessing steps!\n",
    "- There are 14 subfolders (a1, a2, a3, etc), so when completed the folder ```out``` should have 14 CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should include functions that you have written wherever possible. Try to break your code down into smaller self-contained parts, rather than having it as one long set of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you are welcome to submit your code either as a Jupyter Notebook, or as ```.py``` script. If you do not know how to write ```.py``` scripts, don't worry - we're working towards that!\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you are welcome to edit this README file to contain whatever informatio you like. Remember - documentation is important!\n"
